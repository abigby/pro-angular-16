I have been trying to complete my implementation for XDR-475 and I am seeing this error when I try to open any file at all. It seems as if the entire file system is not working in the EC2 environment. I can login to the terminal successfully, but afterwards, I am unable to do anything else. I am not sure what initiatives are being taken to resolve all of our issues with the environment to allow us to work efficiently
